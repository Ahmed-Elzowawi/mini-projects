# Mini-projects

A collection of random projects written in HTML, CSS, and javascript.

**Note: This repository was created to keep me active on GitHub. Therefore, some of these projects
may contain some "bugs".**

Can't you fix these bugs?\
I can easily fix the bugs, but these projects are not taken seriously.
